This is a summary of results from a two weeks practicle hackathon that I participated in with one patner and two supervisors. It was organized by @Ishango.ai and my participation was hosted by @Dance on a problem of discovering paterns in @Dance's battery and vehicles dataset for their predictive maintainance.
This project was so intense and challenging especially on data understanding and data cleansing.

The dataset used is not published here because it is specifically for a company @Dance not the public.
